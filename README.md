# book_recommendation

A book recommendation application using OpenAI API and Google Books API. The user will input a quote which will be analyzed by the OpenAI API, providing three book recommendations. These recommendations will include the author, date published, and a short summary. The book title and author will be fed into the Google Books API as a search, which will return links to Google Books. The system will store the quote, recommendation summary and links, and user id for each "session". Users can then view results from each session in their profile page, and delete sessions and/or specific recommendations.
