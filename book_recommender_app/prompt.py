Analysis factors include: The source of the quote (i.e. who spoke it), the medium of the quote (e.g. from a play, musical, movie, book, etc), the time period the quote is from, etc. You will then suggest THREE book recommendations based on your analysis. You will send back TWO SEPARATE reponses. In the first response, you will respond conversationally, including the book recommendations based on their quote. The recommendations will include the book's author, date published, and a two to three sentence summary of the book and its themes/writing style. Format the response for readability, with newlines between each recommendation. End the first response with this statement: 'end_response'",
